# An example of a Domino model API endpoint to be used with the React app

The notebook included creates,
- MLflow experiment in your Domino project

- Registers the model with the Domino model manager

  
Once the model is in the Domino model manager, you can create an endpoint from that model. This will create a Domino model API endpoint. Note down the model API endpoint URL to be used with the main React App.
